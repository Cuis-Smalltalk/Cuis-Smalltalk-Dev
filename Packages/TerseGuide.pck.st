Show a terse guide to Cuis in a system window. The window has a text pane with a list pane beside it. The text pane is a kind of Workspace which has the behavior that statements in it can be Done (Cmd-d) or Printed (Cmd-p) in order to observe their effect.

I represent a topic that can be added to the TerseGuide. Subclasses of me should implement #title and #examples. For instance:

>>title
    ^ 'Numbers'

>> examples
     ^ {
            { #code -> '4 factorial' . #category -> 'Common functions' . #description -> 'factorial' } as: Dictionary.
            { #code -> '2 even' . #category -> 'Common functions' . #description -> 'check if a number is even' } as: Dictionary.
        }!

coding
	"Code Patterns"

'"
These are Cuis code patterns intended to help the programmer exploit some of the features of Cuis classes. The examples separate the model from the view and feature two styles: coupled and decoupled.

The coupled style employs the ''dependency mechanism'' and requires the model to change when the view changes and when views which use the model are added. The primary methods of the dependency mechanism are #changed: and #update: .

The decoupled style employs the ''observer pattern'' which ensures that the model can remain unaffected by changes to the view or by additional views. The primary methods of the observer pattern are #triggerEvent: and #when:send:to: . This is the preferred style for Cuis, although both styles can be found in the base.

The basic idea is that a Feature is implemented by the Package(s) it contains.

You can load Features in your code or by..."

Feature require: #''Feature-Name''.

"You can also use the File List window to install a feature which can be in any directory (World Menu -> Open-> File List). After selecting a feature, click on ''installPackage''.

A feature may depend on other features and particular versions of those features.  Cuis checks for dependencies and if all dependencies are satisfied will load packages in the proper order.

You can create your own packages and add/remove feature requirements using the Package Browser.  World Menu -> Open -> Installed Packages


There are many features for Cuis available at GitHub.

In a web browser, 
1. view https://github.com
2. type ''Cuis-Smalltalk'' in the search box
3. see the number of features available.

When you invoke:"

Feature require: #''Feature-Name''.

"Cuis will search for packages (*.pck.st) which supply the feature in...

1. the image directory and its subdirectories ''Packages'' and ''CompatibilityPackages'' 
2. siblings of the image directory whose names start with ''Cuis-Smalltalk*'' and their subdirectories named ''Packages'' and ''CompatibilityPackages''.

"Additional information is available on the web page:

''https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev/blob/master/Documentation/CuisAndGitHub.md''


For an example of specifying feature requirements, consider the package file ''Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev/Packages/Graphics-Files-Additional.pck.st'' which can be viewed with the File List browser. It provides feature ''Graphics-Files-Additional'' and requires Feature ''Compression''. If in code or in a Workspace you invoke (Cmd-d):"

introduction
	"Using Terse Guide"
	^
'"
You are reading this in the text pane of the Terse Guide window. This pane is a kind of Workspace and is managed by the SmalltalkEditor of Cuis. This means that you can Do (Cmd-d) or Print (Cmd-p) statements in order to see the result. If you have a Transcript open, the result will appear in it.

The SmalltalkEditor enables you to Do or Print a statement when the cursor is in the statement. It is not necessary to first highlight the entire statement, unless it continues on more than one line.

This text pane is refreshed each time it is accessed. You can change the examples and run them without hurting anything. Go ahead and experiment!!

The Terse Guide does not attempt to provide the entire protocol of a topic. You are encouraged to explore further by using the Protocol Browser as follows:

Button 1>World>Open...>Browser 
then in the upper right pane:
Button 2>Message List>browse protocol

You can narrow the scope of protocol browsing by selecting a class in the upper left pane of the Protocol Browser.

'	"Some messages in the system are responded to primitively. A primitive   
	response is performed directly by the interpreter rather than by evaluating   
	expressions in a method. The methods for these messages indicate the   
	presence of a primitive response by including <primitive: xx> before the   
	first expression in the method.   
	  
	Primitives exist for several reasons. Certain basic or ''primitive'' 
	operations cannot be performed in any other way. Smalltalk without 
	primitives can move values from one variable to another, but cannot add two 
	SmallIntegers together. Many methods for arithmetic and comparison 
	between numbers are primitives. Some primitives allow Smalltalk to 
	communicate with I/O devices such as the disk, the display, and the keyboard. 
	Some primitives exist only to make the system run faster; each does the same 
	thing as a certain Smalltalk method, and its implementation as a primitive is 
	optional.  
	  
	When the Smalltalk interpreter begins to execute a method which specifies a 
	primitive response, it tries to perform the primitive action and to return a 
	result. If the routine in the interpreter for this primitive is successful, 
	it will return a value and the expressions in the method will not be evaluated. 
	If the primitive routine is not successful, the primitive ''fails'', and the 
	Smalltalk expressions in the method are executed instead. These 
	expressions are evaluated as though the primitive routine had not been 
	called.  
	  
	The Smalltalk code that is evaluated when a primitive fails usually 
	anticipates why that primitive might fail. If the primitive is optional, the 
	expressions in the method do exactly what the primitive would have done (See 
	Number @). If the primitive only works on certain classes of arguments, the 
	Smalltalk code tries to coerce the argument or appeals to a superclass to find 
	a more general way of doing the operation (see SmallInteger +). If the 
	primitive is never supposed to fail, the expressions signal an error (see 
	SmallInteger asFloat).  
	  
	Each method that specifies a primitive has a comment in it. If the primitive is 
	optional, the comment will say ''Optional''. An optional primitive that is not 
	implemented always fails, and the Smalltalk expressions do the work 
	instead.  
	 
	If a primitive is not optional, the comment will say, ''Essential''. Some 
	methods will have the comment, ''No Lookup''. See Object 
	howToModifyPrimitives for an explanation of special selectors which are 
	not looked up.  
	  
	For the primitives for +, -, *, and bitShift: in SmallInteger, and truncated 
	in Float, the primitive constructs and returns a 16-bit 
	LargePositiveInteger when the result warrants it. Returning 16-bit 
	LargePositiveIntegers from these primitives instead of failing is 
	optional in the same sense that the LargePositiveInteger arithmetic 
	primitives are optional. The comments in the SmallInteger primitives say, 
	''Fails if result is not a SmallInteger'', even though the implementor has the 
	option to construct a LargePositiveInteger. For further information on 
	primitives, see the ''Primitive Methods'' part of the chapter on the formal 
	specification of the interpreter in the Smalltalk book."'! !
