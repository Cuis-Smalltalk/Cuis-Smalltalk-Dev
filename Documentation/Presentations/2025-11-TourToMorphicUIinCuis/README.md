# A tour to the Morphic UI in Cuis

UIs for Web applications are usually made of UI controls from a standardized, pre-made set. The design of a User Interface involves composing them to show the state of the application, and to allow the user to modify it. The same happens with Desktop and Mobile apps. Morphic is a User Interface framework that encourages the construction of domain specific visual metaphors and interactive graphical objects. Originally created for Self in 1993, it was reimplemented for Squeak in 1997. It was later redesigned for Cuis where it is called Morphic 3. This new design enabled the incremental inclusion of higher quality Vector Graphics and other advanced features while at the same time greatly simplifying the development of application code. Morphic and the ideas it is based on are still exotic to mainstream Software Development practice. In this talk I’ll explain them and demo them in the working system.
