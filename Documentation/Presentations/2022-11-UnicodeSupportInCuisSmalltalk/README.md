# Unicode support in Cuis Smalltalk

[Paper](2022-11-UnicodeSupportInCuisSmalltalk.pdf) written by Juan and presented at the ["FAST Workshop 2022 on Smalltalk Related Technologies"](https://openreview.net/group?id=FAST.org.ar/2022/Workshop&referrer=[Homepage]). It describes the approach used to support Unicode in Smalltalk source code and generally in Text objects. It also includes a review of pitfalls in the implementation of Unicode in other programming languages and the lessons learnt from them.

## Abstract
Any modern development environment needs to provide good support for Unicode text.
Cuis Smalltalk presents a specific set of requirements, and offers a unique set of resources
for implementing it. Additionally, Unicode has been around for long enough to allow for
a critical view on existing implementations. This paper describes the motivations, choices
and implementation strategies of the support for Unicode recently added to Cuis

## Notes
This was written in 2022 and reflects the state of the system at that time. Since then, a few things have changed. Please keep them in mind as you read the paper:
- Utf8String is now called UnicodeString.
- Utf8Symbol is now called UnicodeSymbol.
- UnicodeCodePoint was integrated into Character.  Character includes the whole Unicode space.
- UnicodeString instances are mutable. #at:put: is supported. The #hash value can change if a UnicodeString is modified, just as in String.
- "Future Work" Combining characters are correctly handled.
- "Future Work" Character equivalence, composition, decomposition and normalization are supported.
