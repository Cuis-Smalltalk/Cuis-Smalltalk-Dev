The Cuis project was started in 2004 with the goal of turning Morphic into a Zoomable User Interface, based on high quality Vector Graphics. While Cuis has always been the cleanest and most malleable Open Source Smalltalk, fulfilling the original goal had been delayed. This has changed in the last few years. Cuis is now making this dream come true.
