The Cuis project was started in 2004 with the goal of building a Smalltalk-80 system that can evolve with ease into the future. This meant a deep redesign of many core parts of the system, to enable the addition of new features like a Vector Graphics based Morphic GUI, TrueType fonts and Unicode support. Other advanced features include the bootstrap of minimal images and support for binary format for code libraries. In this talk we'll explore more recent developments, and plans for future work, to better satisfy the needs of developers, teachers, students and businesses.
