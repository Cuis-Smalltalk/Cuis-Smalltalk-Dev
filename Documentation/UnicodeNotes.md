Unicode support in Cuis
---------------

Cuis supports Unicode. There's not acually much else to say, because you usually don't need to know the internal details. Just use String literals and variables as usual, and you are not limited to ASCII or the Latin alphabet anymore.

Source code files are UTF-8, like all text files are in Cuis by default. You can use any Unicode letter (from any alphabet) in class names, method selectors, temporary and instance variable names, symbols, etc. You can use any Unicode math operator as a binary selector. And you can use any Unicode in String literals and comments.

On the Cuis Montly Meeting had on April 5th, 2023, Juan did an introductory presentation of Unicode in Cuis. Watch the video at https://youtu.be/fWJyLsv1mUw?t=0
