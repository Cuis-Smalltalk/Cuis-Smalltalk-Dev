"I think you have a very elegant design aesthetic... Well, advice is easy; design is hard. Good luck with Morphic 3.0! "

"It's one of the smallest, definitely the fastest, and probably the best structured (Squeak) kernel that has been built. Juan spent a lot of time on it and it shows."

"My favorite playful Smalltalk right now: Cuis. It is so small, yet has all of the coolest parts of Squeak and extends into areas like ML and vector graphics. It feels accessible and manageable."

"I fell so enthusiastic about Cuis. It gave me back enthusiasm regarding programming with Smalltalk.
With Cuis, the limits are your creativity and the energy you put in the balance; Cuis is very rarely an obstacle. For a casual programmer as me it is critical, my time is precious and every minutes spend on Cuis must be productive.
Thanks Juan. Thanks too to its capable, friendly and warm community."
