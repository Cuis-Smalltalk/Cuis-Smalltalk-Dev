### The Open Smalltalk VM ###

Cuis runs on the [Open Smalltalk](https://opensmalltalk.org) VM. The latest release of this vm is included in the CuisVM.app folder, for the following platforms: Linux-arm64, Linux-x86_64, MacOS-arm, MacOS-x86_64, Windows-x86_64.

If you want to use a newer, unreleased build of the OpenSmalltalk VM, you can grab them from [Open Smalltalk Builds](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/actions). You can replace the included VM in the CuisVM.app folder, or you can store it elsewhere and adapt the RunCuisOnLinux.sh, RunCuisOnMacTerminal.sh or RunCuisOnWindows.bat scripts.
