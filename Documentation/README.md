## Smalltalk introductory material

A [general introduction to Smalltalk](https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/smalltalk/01-quick-introduction/) by Mark Volkmann.

The Cuis Smalltalk Book, written by Hilaire Fernandes with Ken Dickey and Juan Vuletich. You can read it [online](https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook) or download the pdf version from https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook/releases/latest/ (click on TheCuisBook.pdf)

[Inside Smalltalk vol.1](https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/FreeBooks/InsideST/InsideSmalltalk.pdf). Excellent introduction to Smalltalk-80. The browser and other tools look outdated, but all the concepts are fully up to date. Don't pay much attention to chapters 9 and 10, though. Cuis is several generations more modern than the classic MVC GUI.

[The Blue Book](https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf). This is the first book devoted to Smalltalk-80. It is a great introduction to OOP and Smalltalk. As above, MVC and Pen are are outdated wrt Cuis.

This is a great series of [introductory videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMkq_h36PcLCtLKrrdOKKFV2r267VFH_t) in Spanish by Hernán Wilkinson.
