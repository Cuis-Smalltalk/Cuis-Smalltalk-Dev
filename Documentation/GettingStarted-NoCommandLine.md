# Quick setup for MacOS and Windows #

What follows are instructions for setting up Cuis on Windows or Mac OS X without using Git or the command line. If you are comfortable with Git, please see [Getting started using Git Bash](GettingStarted.md). This document describes the simplest way to run Cuis on your computer.

## On Windows ##
* Create a new folder in your machine using Windows Explorer
* download [`master.zip`](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev/archive/master.zip), saving it to that folder.
* extract the contents of the zip file right there ("extract here")
* download [`squeak.cog.spur_win32x86_201901172323.zip`](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/releases/download/201901172323/squeak.cog.spur_win32x86_201901172323.zip), saving it to yourFolder\Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev-master\ (the folder that was just created while extracting the first zip file).
* extract the contents of the zip file right there ("extract here")
* drop the Cuis5.0-4360-32.image over the Squeak.exe file. Alternatively, double click on the Squeak.exe file, and when prompted to select an image file, select Cuis5.0-4360-32.image.
* If you get a message like "This publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?", then untag "Always ask before opening this file" (if present) and click [Run].
* If you get a message like "Windows protected your PC", then click on "More info", and click [Run anyway].

## On Mac OS X ##
* Create a new folder in your machine using Mac Finder
* download [`master.zip`](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev/archive/master.zip) to your folder
* extract the contents of the zip file (double click on it)
* download [`squeak.cog.spur_macos64x64_201901172323.dmg`](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/releases/download/201901172323/squeak.cog.spur_macos64x64_201901172323.dmg), saving it to your folder
* double click on the dmg file
* Drag Squeak to your folder
* drop the Cuis5.0-4360.image over the Squeak.app file
* If you get "Squeak is an app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?", click on [Open]

## Troubleshooting ##
* If you can't find Cuis5.0-4360.image, then this document is outdated. Use the Cuis image with the latest update number available.
* If you can't find the Squeak Cog Spur VM specified, then this document is outdated. Use the the Squeak Cog Spur VM for your platform with the latest Date and Time available from https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/releases/latest or http://opensmalltalk.org/
* If you can't get Cuis to run on your system after trying the above instructions, send mail to the Cuis-Dev mail list. Please give enough detail of your system, what you tried, and any error messages you got.
