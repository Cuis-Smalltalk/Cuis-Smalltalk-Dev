  Neo Euler
  --------------------------------------------

  This file provides detailed information on the Neo Euler 
  Font Software.
  This information should be distributed along with the Neo 
  Euler font and any derivative works
  
  Neo Euler Font Information
  
  An OpenType/Unicode math port of AMS Euler font 
  https://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/eulermath/
  Our goal is to create an OpenType MATH-enabled font 
  euler.otf, by combining the existing Euler math fonts with 
  new glyphs from Hermann Zapf and adding MATH table 
  information.
  
  The MATH table work is almost done, and initial glyph 
  review by Zapf have been conducted and implemented, see
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb29-2/tb92hagen-euler.pdf 
  and 
  http://river-valley.tv/reshaping-euler-a-collaboration-with-
  hermann-zapf/
  for more details about the review process. We are planning 
  for another review before the first official beta.

  ChangeLog
  
  23 May 2015 (Christoph Haag) 
- created fontforge sources as base to work on GNU/Linux
- added FONTLOG to .sfdir
- Mastered Font from Fontforge SFDIR to 
  UFO,OTF,TTF,EOT,WOFF,SVG
  
  20 Oct 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Reset DisplayOperatorMinHeight to 1400
  
  15 Oct 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add TopAccentHorizontal position to cdot (U+00B7)
  
  05 Oct 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add U+21A9, U+21AA, U+27F5-27FE arrows. We should be 
  covering the common math arrows now.
- Add ssty variant of U+21A9 and U+21AA
- Add U+22A2-22A5. Skeleton copied from CM, but using a 
  stroke thickness of 40 with butt line cap to match Euler.
- Add U+2206 (`\emptyset`)
  
  03 Oct 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add U+21A6 (`\mapsto`) and its mirror arrow U+21A4
  
  23 Sep 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add U+210E and U+210F
- Add bold Nabla (U+1D6C1). Just a 180 rotated Delta, also 
  fix the non bold ones which were rotated in the wrong 
  direction.
  
  11 Jun 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Fix rendering of vertical composites in Office
- Fix vertical placement of wide accents
  
  01 May 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Modify percent sign. Use scaled down oldstyle zero in the 
  percent sign instead of the scaleddown small o.
- A different hyphen. Use hyphen from the pfb file Hans 
  gave to me, I was using a thicker one but it didn't blend 
  well the plus sign.
  
  28 Apr 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add some missing ASCII symbols. Hans wants to use the 
  font to set regular text, so here are the missing $, %, -, 
  _ and @. The glyphs are based loosely on Palatino's 
  counterparts but using Euler glyphs.
  
  01 Mar 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Scale Euler a bit to match Palatino
  
  31 Jan 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Better (un-round) combining arrows. More sharp combining 
  arrows, based on Asana Math ones.
- Cleanup
  
  30 Jan 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add some spacing accents. ConTeXt is using spacing 
  accents instead of combining ones, though this is IMO wrong 
  approach, I just duplicated the said glyphs.     
- Also fix a gap in combining arrows (\vec et al).
     
  22 Jan 2010 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add U+2225. Used for \Vert by ConTeXt (thanks to Aditya 
  Mahajan).
  
  19 Dec 2009 (Taco Hoekwater)
- Some glyph fixes as suggested by Hermann Zapf
   * U+0393: shortened the nose
   * U+0396: lengthened the top stroke to the left
             (so it is no longer a ref to U+005A)
   * U+0398: drop the internal serifs, narrowed the shell a 
  bit
   * U+039F: narrowed a bit (copy of the shell of U+0398)
   * U+03A3: add a serif at the bottom
   * U+03A5: shortened the wings
   * U+03A6: dropped the serif and narrowed the centre stoke 
  a bit
  
  15 Dec 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Unround ssty radicals
- Fix integrals italic corrections. Based on explanations 
  from MS math developers, italic correction of large 
  operators is now set so that superscript is placed 
  immediately after glyph and subscript position is 
  subtracted superscript position by italic correction.
  
  04 Nov 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Changed the stroke ends to butt for radicals
- No more glyphs hanging below base line. This is a TeX 
  legacy that doesn't make sense anymore.
  
  18 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add uni228E, uni2291 and uni2292
  
  15 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Changed the stroke ends to butt for: 0x2190-0x2199, 
  0x2229, 0x222A, 0x2282, 0x2283
  
  14 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Support running with MkII as well (thanks to Aditya)
- Unround the endings of extended slashes. Replace the 
  rounded endings of extended slashes (inherited from CM) 
  with sharp ones similar to normal size slash.
- Add extended backslashes. Constructed by flipping 
  extended slashes horizontally.
- Add new 43 symbol glyphs
  
  12 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Increase DisplayOperatorMinHeight value. Otherwise, 
  display \int will be to small, also disable vertical 
  construction of \int so that the display size glyph will be 
  used instead of the constructed one (for better 
  compatibility of original Euler font).
  
  09 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Update to match latest 'unicode-math' package
  
  05 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Minor changes to accents
- Remove 'ss01' and add 'slat' feature instead. Remove 
  'style set 01' that used to map digit one to its 
  alternative forms, and add a more general 'stylistic 
  alternates' feature to map all stylistic alternative forms.
  
  03 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Some modification to make sure no to use CM
- Harmonize ×and ÷with the rest of the font. ×is now a 
  45 degree rotated +, while ÷is a minus and two dots.
- Harmonize vertical variants of ⋀and ⋁ Vertical 
  variants of both glyphs now have the same angle and sharp 
  endings, unlike previous CM based ones.
- Make over and under arrows extensible. Untested, doesn't 
  seem to work with XeTeX.
- Add U+23DC-U+23DF and their horizontal variants
  
  02 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Make identical glyphs references
- Add 'ssty' and vertical variants of additional integrals.
- Mark some more glyphs extended shapes
- Add more glyphs from cmsys fonts
- Add more accents + #
  
  01 Oct 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add \Vert
  
  30 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add some more math accents
- Add ring operator
- Make math asterisk and ring operator as twice as big
- Add proportional to
  
  27 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add angleright/angleleft
- Rename [bB]ig(g) to alt0{1,2,3,4}
- Add combining right/left arrow above/below
  
  25 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add dotmath and periodcentered
- Add devides (U+2223)
- Add asteriskmath
  
  24 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add element, suchas and their negatives
- Add intersection and union signs. Added both signs and 
  copied them to n-array equivalents, I assumed there is no 
  typographical difference for now.
- Add vertical variants of logical and/or. Again, I assumed 
  the n-array variants are typographically the same.
- Add subset, superset and similar glyphs. This adds the 
  glyphs in the range U+2282-U+228B and their ssty variants.
- Fix ellipsis inter-spacing
- Add midline and right/left diagonal ellipsis
  
  23 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add ssty variants of newly added glyphs
- Add prime and reverse prime glyphs. This adds single, 
  double, triple and quadruple primes, single, double and 
  triple revise primes. Glyphs taken from CM single prime, 
  repeated and/or mirrored. Non-script size primes are scaled 
  down 70% and raised above base line.
- Add not equal, not identical and negation slash. Negation 
  slash is just a zero width regular slash, not equal and not 
  identical are combinations with negation slash.
  
  22 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add ellipsis
- Add ratio symbol
- Add quadruple integral
  
  21 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add more glyphs. Those are glyphs that can be built from 
  existing glyphs (e.g. by flipping).
- Add integral vertical construction. Parts are built from 
  the large integral variant.
  
  20 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Set option to use upright Greek
- Add 'dotted square'. This glyph is used by MS Office 2007 
  formula editor as a place holder.
  
  18 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add horizontal kerning. Values are taken from TFM files 
  of eurm10, eurm7, eurm5, eurb10, eurb7, eurb5 fonts.
- Improve "≤" and "≥" glyphs. Copy the ""and ""and 
  parts from their respected glyphs, and modify the "equal 
  to"part to match the reshaped glyphs.
  
  17 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Add math top accent values for the rest of glyphs. Add 
  math top accent values from eurb10, eurb7, eurb5, eusm10, 
  eusm7,eusm5, eusb10, eusb7, eusb5 fonts.
- Add top math accent to Omicron and Chi. Since both glyphs 
  are just copies of Latin ones, they should have the same 
  top accent values as the Latin glyphs.
- Add division slash and fraction. Both glyphs are just a 
  copy of ascii slash, with vertical variants copied from CM.
  
  16 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Fix previously set math accent positioning. I was setting 
  math accent values the wrong way; FontForge has a 
  "Guess"feature, I thought it just computes the half glyph 
  width and thus I was adding the TFM values to it, it turned 
  out to be doing more than this, so now I compute half glyph 
  width myself.
- Use proper 'unicode-math' option
- Add space to font name. Change font name to 'Neo Euler' 
  instead of 'NeoEuler'.
  
  10 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Use CM constructed parenthesis. I was using constructed 
  parenthesis made by adapting regular Euler parenthesis, but 
  it looks ugly and doesn't fit with other large parenthesis 
  taken from CM, so revert back to CM ones for now.
- Add Dotless Forms lookup This lookup substitutes i and j 
  with their dotless forms for math accent positioning.
  
  09 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Italic correction. Values taken from TFM files and 
  converted from points to em units assuming 1pt font size 
  (even for Script and ScriptScript fonts).
- Some blank control chars
- Remove 4 useless glyphs
- Remove texskewchar.ssty[1,2] and uni0020.ssty[1,2] 
  (space).
- Math accent positioning. Values are obtained by summing 
  half the width of the glyph to kern with skewchar from TFM 
  files, but the result isn't identical to using TFM fonts 
  and needs more investigation. Not all glyphs are done 
  yet,though.
- Add circumflex and combining circumflex. Circumflex is 
  used by ConTeXt for \hat, while XeTeX uses "combining 
  circumflex accent"for it, just copy our "circumflex 
  accent"to both slots and make both systems happy.
  
  08 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Fix minusplus sign and add ssty variants. Minusplus wase 
  an upside down plusminus, not that good idea, fixed. Added 
  also Script and ScriptScript glyphs of both plusminus and 
  minusplus.
- Add ss01. Add stylistic set 01 to access the alternate 
  form of digit One.
  
  07 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Copy extra glyphs from CM instead of LM fonts. Replace 
  glyphs copied from LM with glyphs from type1 version of CM, 
  since the later is released by AMS under OFL (the same 
  license of Euler fonts), to avoid any possible licence 
  incompatibilities.
- Hack to force upright letters
- Add left/right floor/ceiling. All glyphs are copied from 
  CM fonts. Vertical construction is actually based on 
  left/right bracket construction.
- Add vertical bar. Vertical variants were created by 
  stretching existing bar char 600 units a time.
  
  05 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Move parenthesis construction glyph to their Unicode code 
  points
- Add plusminus/minusplus glyphs. plusminus is constructed 
  by combining plus and minus glyphs, minusplus is an upside 
  down plusminus.
  
  04 Sep 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Set "Extended Shape"flag for relevant glyphs
- Add \equiv, \leq and \geq glyphs. The glyphs were 
  salvaged from MF sources and converted to splines using 
  mf2pt1.
- Add bracket right/left extended shapes. Copy extended 
  brackets from LM modern fonts, together with vertical 
  construction parts and needed MATH info.
  
  31 Aug 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Make WinAscent and WinDescent offsets not fixed values, 
  so that FontForge will calculate it from highest/deepest 
  glyph, otherwise the font is broken under Ms Office 
  (Windows cuts glyphs outside those values).
  
  17 Jul 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Radical (glyphs copied from LM)
- move some glyphs around
- Parenthesis (variants from LM)
  
  06 Jul 2009 (Khaled Hosny)

- 'onum' feature.
- Remove unused encoding slots.
- Copy some math extension glyphs to their unicode code 
  points.
- Move curly bracket extensions to their unicode code 
  points.

  27 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Merge of new euler fonts.
- oldstyle numbers replaced ordinary ones.
- Font rename and acender/descender fix.
- MathConstants.
  
  25 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Original Euler equivalence, lessorequalslant and 
  greaterorequalslant resuscitated from MF source using 
  mf2pt1.
- One item less
- One item more
  
  23 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- bar construction.
- fraction
- More items.
- More formulas.
- Use upright greek symboles for italic ones as well.
- Use Fraktur for the title.
- Fixed missing greek, now I need to get bold too.
  
  22 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- More math symbols from LM.
- hat and tildecomb.
- Arbitrary math constants just to get the font working, to 
  be redone soon.
- Slight fix to the test.
- More constants.
- Font rename.
- Fix tilde glyph.
- Real math constants.
  
  21 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- integral and its vertical variant.
- Extended shapes.
  
  20 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- Curly brackets construction.
- Fixed ascent and descent values, not an offset.
  
  19 Jun 2009 (Khaled Hosny)
- This is a merge of the four 10pt font files:
   * Mapped to Unicode math as possible.
   * Variants names has alt(2) extention.
   * No OpenType layout yet.
- better rules.
- Oldstyle figures lookup.
- Move curly brackets constructors to proper code points.
- product, cproduct, summation and contintegral + MATH 
  GlyphVariantsVertical entries for each.
- Initialize MATH table.
