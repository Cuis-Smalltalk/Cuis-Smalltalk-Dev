The Freeware Font(s) included in this pack were created by Jess Latham. I am inspired by my uncontrolable love for music and graphic design. All fonts are original works.

Please read the legal notice below. Basically what it is saying is that I'm human and although I work very hard to make fonts that work well, I'm not perfect.
