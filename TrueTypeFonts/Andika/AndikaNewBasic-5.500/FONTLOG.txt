Andika New Basic
==========================


This file provides detailed information on the Andika family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
that will not be easily confused with one another.

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to work with
fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers.
In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble 
letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters
needed in their particular language community, resulting in confusing 
and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.

A hallmark of Andika's versatility for global use is its selection of
alternate letterforms. These alternates are accessible via OpenType and
Graphite font features. For applications that do not support OpenType or
Graphite, TypeTuner Web (http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi) allows
you to download a custom font with your choice of which forms should be
the default. TypeTuner is also available as a standalone utility -
(http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner).

Andika New Basic is a limited-character-set version of Andika that includes
a full family of styles (Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic).

In particular, these fonts do not support:
   Full extended Latin IPA
   Complete support for Central European languages
   Greek
   Cyrillic

What is the difference between Andika and Andika New Basic?
   Andika has a more complete character set comparable to
     Charis SIL and Doulos SIL
   Andika New Basic has a limited character set, supporting only the Basic
     Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the
     more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscellaneous
     diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation.
   Andika New Basic has all four faces: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic

What is the difference between Andika Basic (2008) and Andika New Basic?
   Andika New Basic has all four faces: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic
   Andika New Basic has a few more characters than Andika Basic
   Andika New Basic uses different glyphs for "a" and "r" based characters
     than Andika Basic, and are identical to the main Andika font
   Graphite feature identifiers were integers in Andika Basic and are
     4-character alphanumeric tags in Andika New Basic


We are actively working on updating the full-character-set Andika to include
all four faces (Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic).


Features
--------

Andika New Basic has:
   OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
   A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
   Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode and the SIL PUA
   Character assignments updated to conform to Unicode 7.0

Andika New Basic supports a subset of Andika's smart font features:
   Uppercase Eng alternates
   Capital N-left-hook alternate
   Capital Q alternate
   Capital Y-hook alternate
   Literacy alternates -- single-story a and g -- as default glyphs
   Modifier apostrophe alternates
   Modifier colon alternate
   Digit Zero with slash
   Digit One without base
   Digit Four with open top
   Digit Six and Nine alternates
   Digit Seven with bar
   Open-O alternate
   Small i-tail alternate
   Small j-serif alternate
   Small l-tail alternate
   Small q-tail alternate
   Small t-tail alternate
   Small y-tail alternate
   Vietnamese-style diacritics

Andika New Basic also includes one new feature:
   Capital J alternate

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Andika" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Andika.
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used,
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and
"Andika" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named
"Andika Non-Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Andika" or "SIL"
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like
"Write Sans".
