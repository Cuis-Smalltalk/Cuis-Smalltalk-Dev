	 Sort nicely: major order is alphabetical by category name, and within a category alphabetical by class name.
	 Earlier versions used the order of the category within the system organization, but that gives different orders
	 when programmers reorder the system categories to suit their wishes. Since this order decides the order of
	 package file-outs, ignoring the speicifc system category order and using its alphabetical order is important
	 for stable package file-out. eem; '24/6/17"
