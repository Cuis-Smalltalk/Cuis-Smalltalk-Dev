The compiler accepts Smalltalk source code and compiles it with respect to a given class. The user of the compiler supplies a context so that temporary variables are accessible during compilation. If there is an error, a requestor is sent the message notify:at:in: so that the error message can be displayed. If there is no error, then the result of compilation is a MethodNode, which is the root of a parse tree whose nodes are kinds of ParseNodes. The parse tree can be sent messages to (1) generate code for a CompiledMethod (this is done for compiling methods or evaluating expressions); (2) pretty-print the code (for formatting); or (3) produce a map from object code back to source code (used by debugger program-counter selection). See also Parser, Encoder, ParseNode.

I scan a string or text, picking out Smalltalk syntactic tokens. I look one character ahead. I put each token found into the instance variable, token, and its type (a Symbol) into the variable, tokenType. At the end of the input stream, I pretend to see an endless sequence of special characters called doIts.

Instance Variables
	aheadChar:		<Character>
	buffer:		<WriteStream>
	currentComment:		<OrderedCollection>
	hereChar:		<Character>
	mark:		<Integer>
	source:		<ReadStream>
	token:		<Symbol|String|NumberCharacter|Boolean|nil>
	tokenType:		<Symbol>
	typeTable:		<Array>

aheadChar
	- the next character in the input stream

buffer
	- a reusable WriteStream on a String which is used for building strings. Shouldn't be used from multiple methods without resetting.

currentComment
	- an OrderedCollection of strings which contain all comments between the current token and the previous token or the beginning of the source.

hereChar
	- the current character

mark
	- the position of the current token in the source stream

source
	- the input stream of characters

token
	- the current token

tokenType
	- the type of the current token. The possible token types are: #binary, #character, #colon, #doIt, #keyword, #leftArrow, #leftBrace, #leftBracket, #leftParenthesis, #literal, #period, #rightBrace, #rightBracket, #rightParenthesis, #semicolon, #string, #upArrow, #verticalBar, #word, #xBinary, #xColon, #xDelimiter, #xDigit, #xDollar, #xDoubleQuote, #xLetter, #xLitQuote, #xSingleQuote, #xUnderscore

typeTable
	- an array that maps each an evaluable tokenType to each character with asciiValue between 0 and 255

I parse Smalltalk syntax and create a MethodNode that is the root of the parse tree. I look one token ahead.
