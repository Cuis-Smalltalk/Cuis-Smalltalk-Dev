HOW IT WORKS (Try this in any other language :-)
Since your code (the last 2 lines in the above example) is in a block,
this method gets control to display its heading before, and clean up 
the screen after, its execution.
The key, though, is that the block is supplied with an argument,
named 'bar' in the example, which will update the bar image every 
it is sent the message value: x, where x is in the from:to: range.

The use of ProgressInitiationException allows for avoiding actual
progress display, by catching the exception.
